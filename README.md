# katello-perf

`create-katello-os1.sh` is designed to get you up and running on an openstack instance quickly for katello performance testing, though it has already been abandoned in favor of beaker.

`perfhammer` uses hammer-cli to populate a katello 2.4 machine with lots of data fore perfomance testing.
